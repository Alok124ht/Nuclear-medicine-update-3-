CT coronary angiography: luminography and beyond
CT coronary angiography: are we there yet?
Coronary catheter angiography (CCA) is still considered to
be the clinical standard technique for the evaluation of
CAD. However, the risk of serious complications associated
with CCA is not negligible, and inconvenience for the
patient and economic deliberations have strengthened the
search for a non-invasive alternative. Currently, CT is the
most promising imaging technique for the non-invasive
evaluation of the coronary artery tree. Current CT technology
combines high spatial and temporal resolution with fast
volume coverage, thus enabling imaging of the small and
fast-moving coronary arteries within a single breath-hold.
A huge number of publications have abounded evaluating
the diagnostic performance of CT coronary angiography.
With continuous development in CT system
generations—starting with four-slice CT until the advent
of the most recent 320-slice and second-generation dualsource
CT systems—the diagnostic accuracy performs as
follows [2]. Patients with significant morphological coronary
stenoses are detected with a sensitivity of 95% or
higher. With modern technology, the specificity to detect
patients with significant morphological coronary artery
stenoses with CT showed steady improvement. In parallel,
the number of segments showing a non-diagnostic image
quality decreased. Most importantly, the negative predictive
value of CT coronary angiography has been reported in

The most important clinical indication for CT coronary
angiography is the evaluation of chest pain syndrome in
patients with intermediate pre-test probability of CAD and
uninterpretable ECG, or the inability of the patient to
undergo exercise testing [3]. On the other hand, patients
with a high pre-test probability of CAD should not
undergo CT coronary angiography. Similarly, in patients
with a low pre-test probability, the appropriateness of CT
coronary angiography is considered uncertain. In a clinical
context, CT should be used as a filter test: When the CT
coronary angiography test results are negative, no further
invasive work-up is required, and when the results are
positive, CCA should subsequently be performed in most
cases.
